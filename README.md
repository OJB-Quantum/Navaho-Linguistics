# Navaho-Linguistics
A repository for Indigenous American language material from the Navaho/Navajo tribe. Collected and written by Onri Jay Benally, an Indigenous American born and raised on the Navaho tribe (Diné Bikeyah).

The Navaho language is highly descriptive and has a heavy presence of verb usage. It is important to note that the many biomes and change of landscape found on the tribal lands are contributing factors to the existence of various Navaho dialects. This is especially true for the mountainous regions, where pronuciation and modern spelling can vary in a slight manner. 

As one might expect, the Navaho language was only spoken through oral expression for thousands of years in what is now North America. Not until relatively recent history did Navaho linguists and language experts decide to pick a written form that could adopt Navaho phonetics. So far, the Latin script (commonly used to write English alphabets) has been the default for writing. There are other scripts such as Cryillic (commonly used to write Slavic alphabets, including Russian) that can express Navaho phonetics as well, however it is not actively taught or practiced in the tribe. Either way, the spelling of words are expected to be pronounced phonetically. 

For example, it is generally known that Diné has two English spellings: Navaho and Navajo (both pronounced the same). The letter (j), used in the word Navajo, is exclusive to the spelling of the word. If one observes (j) in any other Diné word, then it should be pronunced the same as the English letter (j) or its linearized form (dzh). Keep this in mind.
