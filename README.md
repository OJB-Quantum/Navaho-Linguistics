A repository for Indigenous American language material for quantum engineering topics from the Diné/Navaho/Navajo tribe. Collected and written by Onri Jay Benally, an Indigenous American quantum hardware engineer born and raised on the Navaho tribe (Diné Bikeyah). This is a life-long project. 

In January of 2024, this open-access repository became part of an approved proposal funded by the [Arizona State University (ASU) Quantum Collaborative](https://quantumcollaborative.org) network. 

The official funding start date is: June 2nd of 2025. 

The official funded project name is: Quantum Hardware Engineering Education Augmented Through Navaho Linguistics.

Primary URL for the repository: [OJB-Quantum/Navaho-Linguistics](https://github.com/OJB-Quantum/Navaho-Linguistics)

### Pro tip by Onri: 
- Navaho root words often start with 'a', 'b', 'h', 'n', 's', 't', or 'y' sounds. 
- Also, when a word starts with an 'a', 'e', 'i', or an 'o' sound (Navaho vowels) and their variations, it is usually preceded by an apostrophe. 
- Note that since Navaho/ Navajo is a speaking-focused language, you may notice variations of word spellings in writing, whether in literature or video or other media. It is possible to provide a more correct spelling in writing when converting speech to text to accurately match the phonetics. 
- Using the term 'particular' in English usually means to single out something, and the equivalent of this is used heavily in Navaho to highlight objects.

#### How this was encoded

* High-tone vowels are single cells: **á** ⟶ ⠷ (dots-12356), **é** ⟶ ⠮ (dots-2346), **í** ⟶ ⠌ (dots-34), **ó** ⟶ ⠬ (dots-346). 
* Nasal vowels prefix **dots-46** before the vowel; for example **ą** ⟶ ⠨⠁, **ę** ⟶ ⠨⠑. High-tone nasal vowels use dots-46 + the high-tone vowel cell (e.g., **ą́** ⟶ ⠨⠷, **ę́** ⟶ ⠨⠮). 
* The glottal stop and ejective mark (apostrophe **ʼ / ’ / '** in print) are a single **dot-3** cell ⟶ ⠄, used inside words as in **t’**, **neel’ąąh**. 
* The barred ell **ł** is dots-1456 ⟶ ⠹ (per the Navajo consonant table). 
* Capitals use the UEB capital indicator **dot-6** ⟶ ⠠ (e.g., at **Díí**, **T’áá**, **Schrödinger**, **Pauli**, **Dirac**).
* Periods use UEB **dots-256** ⟶ ⠲.
* The **ö** in **Schrödinger** is UEB “diaeresis above the following letter,” written with the UEB diaeresis indicator before **o** (shown here as ⠘⠒ + ⠕ in braille order).

### Notes

• Angle brackets: ⟨…⟩ are ⠨⠨⠷ … ⠨⠨⠾.  Square brackets: ⟦…⟧ here shown as basic ⠈⠷ … ⠈⠾.  Equals: ⠨⠅ (spaced).  Minus: ⠤.  Plus: ⠖.  Centered dot: ⠡.

• Greek: α ⟶ ⠨⠁, β ⟶ ⠨⠃, γ ⟶ ⠨⠛, μ ⟶ ⠨⠍, ψ ⟶ ⠨⠽.

• ∂ is ⠈⠙; ∇ (del) is ⠘⠙; superscripts use ⠘, subscripts use ⠆; overbar (h‑bar) uses the horizontal‑bar sign ⠒ after the base letter.

• Digits use the numeric indicator ⠼ before the first digit when needed for clarity.

### 3 General Categories of Technical Communication by O.J.B.

| Category               | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mathematical Linguistics** | - Logical operations with words. <br> - Can be relayed through Braille, visible, or spoken text. <br> - Aims to formalize & create syntax & morphology. |
| **Linguistical Mathematics** | - Semantics & philosophical-based communication. <br> - Tendency to be abstract, indeterminate, or ambiguous. <br> - Applies mathematical theories to understand linguistic phenomena & existing syntax. |
| **Descriptive Linguistics**  | - Delineated, formulated, stringified, expanded, verbal communication. <br> - Can be relayed through Braille, visible, or spoken text. <br> - Uses the familiar syntax of one’s spoken language for comprehensive documentation. |

### Leveraging the Universal Nature of Geometry with Linguistics:

| **Aspect**                     | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Universal Nature of Geometry** | - Geometry is highly visual and uses universally recognized symbols and diagrams.<br>- Fundamental concepts like points, lines, and shapes are easily understood visually, transcending linguistic barriers.                   |
| **Language's Mathematical Lexicon** | - Requires a well-developed mathematical vocabulary.<br>- Terms can be created or borrowed for effective communication.<br>- Descriptions and analogies can substitute for missing terms.                                       |
| **Teaching Methods**            | - Visual aids (diagrams, models, animations) can overcome linguistic gaps.<br>- Teaching in the learners' native language enhances understanding.<br>- Multilingual strategies can support advanced topics.                    |
| **Linguistic & Cultural Context** | - Relating concepts to cultural or environmental contexts engages learners.<br>- Indigenous languages, like Navajo, can use descriptive translations for geometric terms.                                                  |
| **Technology & Tools**        | - Geometry software and platforms support multilingual learning.<br>- Open Educational Resources (OERs) ensure inclusivity and access to content in various languages.                                                        |
| **Challenges in Advanced Topics** | - Advanced geometry topics may require more specialized terminology.<br>- Language development and contextual examples can address this challenge.                                                                             |
| **Conclusion**                  | - Basic geometry is universally teachable due to its visual and universal nature.<br>- Advanced topics can be effectively taught with creative methods and linguistic adaptability.                                             |

> Employ the leap frog approach, by working on at least 2 deliverables simulataneously, but at a different paces each. 


Notes: 
- The Cryostats to be rendered for later labeling should be focused on the large-frame DR, floor standing cryostat (cryogen-free PPMS-type), and floor standing cryostat (liquid cryogen Dewar type).
- Send cryogenic coils and other curved objects as blend files to Mohamad and Mural.

### Additional Notes on Passive Cryogenic Vessels

| Passive‑vessel subtype                                          | Common cryogens†                              | Practical temperature floor\*                      | Core thermal/ safety constraints                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open “bucket” (wide‑mouth Dewar)**                            | LN₂, LAr (occasionally LO₂ for spot cleaning) | 77 K (LN₂)/ 87 K (LAr)                            | Violent bubbling on warm insertion; splash, frost & rapid O₂ enrichment; zero over‑pressure protection — must remain vented (ehs.lbl.gov)                                                                         |
| **Static storage Dewar**<br>(bench or floor, non‑pressurized)   | LN₂, LAr, LO₂, **LHe (with LN₂ shield)**      | 4.2 K for LHe (inner can)<br>≈ 77 K for LN₂ shield | Multilayer insulation (MLI) plus <10⁻⁵ mbar vacuum to limit radiative & gaseous conduction loads; vented neck to avoid plug ice; shield‑fill adds ≈1 W latent load per liter (americanmagnetics.com, EHRS)                   |
| **Transport Dewar/ ISO tank**<br>(road, sea, or air certified) | LN₂, **LHe**, LH₂ (ISO‑T75)                   | 4.2 K (LHe)/ 20.3 K (LH₂)                         | Must survive continuous vibration & shocks (ADR, IMDG, IATA); dual or triple pressure‑relief trains sized for full flash; seismic‑stop frame & slosh‑baffle for air cargo (Wessington, cryotherminc.com, ehs.lbl.gov) |

†LO₂ and LH₂ add powerful oxidizer/flammability hazards and are therefore restricted to specially cleaned, oxygen‑compatible or hydrogen‑compatible hardware.
*Temperature “floor” means the minimum bath temperature achievable at 1 atm with pure, saturated liquid of the listed cryogen(s).

- **Thermos™**: commercial trademark (1904) for consumer Dewars (vacuum insulated flask); illustrates the generalization of the scientific invention.
- **Cryostat**: a portmanteau of Greek **κρύος** (*kryos*, “frost”) \+ *\-stat* (“to make stand, hold”), literally “cold-keeper.”
- **Dewar** or Dewar flask: is essentially an ultra-efficient, vacuum-insulated “thermos.” Dewar is named after its inventor, Sir James Dewar (1842-1923).
- Open Dewars become impractical for helium because superfluid He-II (below 2.17 K) can “creep” up walls (Rollin film) and escape.
- For millikelvin work, you attach an insert (e.g., dilution refrigerator) to a 4 K flange.
- Some modern laboratories skip stored liquids entirely by tying the “Cryostat” branch’s pulse-tube coolers straight to a helium-recovery compressor; nevertheless, Dewars are still ubiquitous for transport, purge, and backup.
- **Dilution** *(as in “dilution refrigerator”)*: from Latin **diluere** “to wash away/thin out,” via the French term “dilution”. In a dilution refrigerator the *thinning* of a **³He**\-rich phase into a **⁴He**\-rich phase at ≈ 0.87 K absorbs heat (enthalpy of mixing), allowing continuous cooling to **\<10 mK**. The idea was proposed by Heinz London (1951) and first realized experimentally by the Cambridge–Oxford collaboration in the early 1960s; the term “dilution refrigerator” cemented itself as the technology matured through the 1970s.

### What a “Chandelier” Really Is (With Some Examples)

| Term | OEM language | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **XLDsl Dilution Refrigerator Measurement System** | Marketed as a *cryogen-free DR measurement system* with large experimental space. | The entire fridge (including still, heat-exchangers, mixing chamber) is already inside the vacuum can. |
| **High-Density Wiring (side-load or top-load)** | Bluefors calls the modular wiring loom “High-Density Wiring,” compatible with XLD. | Provides hundreds of coax/twisted-pair lines; resembles a metallic “chandelier.” |
| **Colloquial “chandelier”** | Community photos and forum threads show the gold-plated wiring tree hanging from the mixing chamber. | Visual nickname, not a refrigeration stage. |

> **Key idea:** the chandelier is **part of the wiring infrastructure**, not the refrigeration insert. You can call it a **high-density wiring chassis**, a modular loom that brings hundreds of coax, twisted-pair, optical fiber, or ribbon lines down to the mixing-chamber plate. In Bluefors systems the dilution unit is permanently integrated; users add or swap chandeliers (wiring modules, attenuators, filters) to suit qubit count, signal bandwidth, or device technology.

### How to Tell an Insert from a Wiring Tree/ Chassis

| Indicator | Dilution Refrigerator Insert | Wiring “Chandelier” |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Contains still, heat-exchangers, mixing chamber | **Yes** | No |
| Circulates ³He/⁴He mixture | **Yes** | No |
| Must connect to gas-handling system | **Yes** | No |
| Bolts to 50 mK plate; routes cables & attenuators | Optional plate on bottom | **Primary purpose** |
| Delivered as stand-alone module for a pre-existing 4 K cryostat | DynaCool DR insert (dry) | N/A—comes with chassis |

### Indigenous American/ Native American Languages on Google Translate as of 2025:

| Supported in Google Translate                                 | Not Supported                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quechua, Guarani, Aymara, Nahuatl (Eastern Huasteca), Inuktut | Navaho/ Navajo, Cherokee, Cree, Ojibwe, & most U.S. Native languages |

> With the framework produced in this repository, it may be possible to provide the data neccessary to train machines on at least the translation of technical terms, such as quantum technology.

> Additionally, a GPU-accelerated semantic shift [simulation](https://github.com/OJB-Quantum/Monte-Carlo-Sim/blob/main/CUDA%E2%80%91Accelerated_Semantic%E2%80%91Shift_Simulation.ipynb) was produced initially in English by Onri, but can be expanded to the Navaho/ Navajo linguistics framework and compared with Onri's own translation examples for fine-tuning.

> In summer of 2024, the thought of exploring Navajo/ Navaho Braille together with Nemeth (Braille mathematics) came to mind. Although advanced mathematics topics are covered using Nemeth, it would be interesting to see it combined with Navaho/ Navajo Braille to express terms used in quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
> I created a simple tool to help with this idea based on Braille dot generation for expressing quantum mechanics equations and terms: <https://github.com/OJB-Quantum/LaTeX-to-Nemeth-Braille-to-SVG>

> If a language relies less on phonetics or pronunciation based on the spelling, then it is apparent that it requires more memorization. The memorization is of association of pronunciation with a particularly spelled word. 

> Based on some deductive reasoning, this would mean that languages that are heavily phonetic require less memorization of the association mentioned above. However, for languages that are heavily weighted on speaking rather than writing, would require relatively even more memorization.

> Note: Unicode is mentioned in this project due to its convenience of character generation when one desires to correctly spell Navaho words. This form of character generation may provide a robust sequence of protocols for practical language usage in digital form, further strengthening any future initiatives to automate Navaho translation. Another interesting thing is that there are Navaho medical documentation on instrumentation that may be helpful in translating hardware-related topics. This includes microscopes and other advanced spectroscopy techniques in Navaho that we can borrow ideas from for this project.

> A recent paper was published on large language model (LLM) identification of Navaho characters with 100% accuracy. This is big news because this project has so far produced a whole Navaho unicode table already, which could be used for efforts on getting the Navaho language and more native North American languages on Google Translate.

> Showing classical data inputs and classical data outputs, which should be paid close attention to if one desires to build a real quantum computer. Note that one of the main goals in the practical setup of quantum computers is the manipulation of “the quantum object”, which is a size-dependent device or atomic structure, with a natural or designed resonance frequency. This also means that it is typically placed under isolated physical conditions as well (e.g. refrigeration, vacuum sealing, radiation shielding, etc.).
