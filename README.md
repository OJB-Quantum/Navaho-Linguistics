A repository for Indigenous American language material for quantum engineering topics from the Diné/Navaho/Navajo tribe. Collected and written by Onri Jay Benally, an Indigenous American quantum hardware engineer born and raised on the Navaho tribe (Diné Bikeyah). This is a life-long project. In January of 2024, this open-access repository became part of an approved proposal funded by the [Arizona State University (ASU) Quantum Collaborative](https://quantumcollaborative.org) network.

The official funded project name is: Quantum Hardware Engineering Education Augmented Through Navaho Linguistics.

Primary URL for the repository: [OJB-Quantum/Navaho-Linguistics](https://github.com/OJB-Quantum/Navaho-Linguistics)

### 3 General Categories of Technical Communication by O.J.B.

| Category               | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mathematical Linguistics** | - Logical operations with words. <br> - Can be relayed through Braille, visible, or spoken text. <br> - Aims to formalize & create syntax & morphology. |
| **Linguistical Mathematics** | - Semantics & philosophical-based communication. <br> - Tendency to be abstract, indeterminate, or ambiguous. <br> - Applies mathematical theories to understand linguistic phenomena & existing syntax. |
| **Descriptive Linguistics**  | - Delineated, formulated, stringified, expanded, verbal communication. <br> - Can be relayed through Braille, visible, or spoken text. <br> - Uses the familiar syntax of one’s spoken language for comprehensive documentation. |

### Leveraging the Universal Nature of Geometry with Linguistics:

| **Aspect**                     | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Universal Nature of Geometry** | - Geometry is highly visual and uses universally recognized symbols and diagrams.<br>- Fundamental concepts like points, lines, and shapes are easily understood visually, transcending linguistic barriers.                   |
| **Language's Mathematical Lexicon** | - Requires a well-developed mathematical vocabulary.<br>- Terms can be created or borrowed for effective communication.<br>- Descriptions and analogies can substitute for missing terms.                                       |
| **Teaching Methods**            | - Visual aids (diagrams, models, animations) can overcome linguistic gaps.<br>- Teaching in the learners' native language enhances understanding.<br>- Multilingual strategies can support advanced topics.                    |
| **Linguistic & Cultural Context** | - Relating concepts to cultural or environmental contexts engages learners.<br>- Indigenous languages, like Navajo, can use descriptive translations for geometric terms.                                                  |
| **Technology & Tools**        | - Geometry software and platforms support multilingual learning.<br>- Open Educational Resources (OERs) ensure inclusivity and access to content in various languages.                                                        |
| **Challenges in Advanced Topics** | - Advanced geometry topics may require more specialized terminology.<br>- Language development and contextual examples can address this challenge.                                                                             |
| **Conclusion**                  | - Basic geometry is universally teachable due to its visual and universal nature.<br>- Advanced topics can be effectively taught with creative methods and linguistic adaptability.                                             |

### Indigenous American/ Native American Languages on Google Translate as of 2025:

| Supported in Google Translate                                 | Not Supported                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quechua, Guarani, Aymara, Nahuatl (Eastern Huasteca), Inuktut | Navaho/ Navajo, Cherokee, Cree, Ojibwe, & most U.S. Native languages |

> With the framework produced in this repository, it may be possible to provide the data neccessary to train machines on at least the translation of technical terms, such as quantum technology.
> Additionally, a GPU-accelerated semantic shift [simulation](https://github.com/OJB-Quantum/Monte-Carlo-Sim/blob/main/CUDA%E2%80%91Accelerated_Semantic%E2%80%91Shift_Simulation.ipynb) was produced initially in English, but can be expanded to the Navaho/ Navajo linguistics framework and compared with Onri's own translation examples for fine-tuning.

| Plans for this repository (in no particular order): |
|-|
| ✅ Generate a table of Navaho characters in Unicode. |
| ✅ "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" example in Navaho. |
| ✅ Chart formation blueprint. |
| ✅ Cyrillic example for "blue" and "bee" in Navaho. |
| ✅ Generate a table of words & phrases by Onri that need to be converted into digital text. |
| 🔳 Label dilution refrigerator in Navaho. |
| ✅ Label tunnel junctions & physical qubit components in Navaho, may include original electron micrographs & renderings in Blender. Generate device 3D models intended for comparison with micrographs. |
| 🔳 Quantum device spectroscopy, reflectometry, & benchmarking terms in Navaho. |
| 🔳 Incorporation of hybrid qubit terms, able to future support quantum hardware publication. |
| 🔳 Potential descriptions of fractal geometry & recursion. |
| 🔳 Potential contributions to Qiskit/ Qiskit Metal documentation in Navaho (from paper to GitHub pull requests). |
| ✅ Explore draw-to-text features for Navaho characters referencing Unicode. |

> Note: Unicode is mentioned here due to its convenience of character generation when one desires to correctly spell Navaho words. This form of character generation may provide a robust sequence of protocols for practical language usage in digital form, further strengthening any future initiatives to automate Navaho translation. Another interesting thing is that there are Navaho medical documentation on instrumentation that may be helpful in translating hardware-related topics. This includes microscopes and other advanced spectroscopy techniques in Navaho that we can borrow ideas from for this project. 

> In summer of 2024, the thought of exploring Navajo/ Navaho Braille together with Nemeth (Braille mathematics) came to mind. Although advanced mathematics topics are covered using Nemeth, it would be interesting to see it combined with Navaho/ Navajo Braille to express terms used in quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
> I created a simple tool to help with this idea: <https://github.com/OJB-Quantum/LaTeX-to-Nemeth-Braille-to-SVG>

> If a language relies less on phonetics or pronunciation based on the spelling, then it is apparent that it requires more memorization. The memorization is of association of pronunciation with a particularly spelled word. 
> Based on some deductive reasoning, this would mean that languages that are heavily phonetic require less memorization of the association mentioned above. However, for languages that are heavily weighted on speaking rather than writing, would require relatively even more memorization.
