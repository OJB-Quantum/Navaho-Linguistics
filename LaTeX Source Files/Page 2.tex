• Find the root word.

• How does it behave?

• What is the historical relation?

• What is the suffix?

• What is the prefix?

• What are the particles, if any?

• Acknowledge that order doesn't matter that much inside the suffixes \& prefixes.

For the original documentation:

• The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, example in Navaho.

• Cyrillic example for "blue" in Navaho.

• Chart formation blueprint.

• Generate a table of Navaho characters in Unicode.

• Explore a draw-to-text for Navaho characters referencing Unicode.

• Label dilution refrigerator in Navaho.

• Label tunnel junctions \& physical qubit components in Navaho, may include original micrographs \& renderings in Blender.

• Potential contributions to Qiskit/ Qiskit Metal documentation in Navaho (from paper to GitHub pull requests).

Note: Unicode is mentioned here due to its convenience of character generation when one desires to correctly spell Navaho words. This form of character generation may provide a robust sequence of protocols for practical language usage in digital form, further strengthening any future initiatives to automate Navaho translation.
